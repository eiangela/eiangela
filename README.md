# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Devs!! Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm a Junior Front-End Developer passionate about technology and design. Currently, I'm focusing on learning and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to create intuitive and appealing web interfaces.

I've embarked on this exciting career full of challenges and growth opportunities, and I'm eager to absorb knowledge continuously. My dedication and enthusiasm drive me to learn more every day, whether through hands-on projects or theoretical studies.

I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that will allow me to enhance my skills, work in a team environment, share knowledge, and contribute to innovative solutions.

I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and simplify people's daily routines. That's why I'm committed to developing digital solutions that add value and provide memorable user experiences.

In addition to web development, I have an interest in UX/UI design, which enables me to understand the importance of usability and aesthetics in a digital product.
